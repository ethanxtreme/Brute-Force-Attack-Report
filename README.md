# Brute-Force-Attack-Report
Abstract:
This process uses applications and tools in Kali Lunix to perform a brute force
password attack on an SSH server hosted on an Ubuntu Linux VM. The Kali Lunix
machine will be the attacking system, with Ubuntu being the targeted system hosting
the SSH server. The application ‘Hydra’ will be used on Kali Linux in order to
perform the brute force attack.
Introduction:
This example will be using VirtualBox version 7.0.10 with an image of Kali Linux
installed on it. An Ubuntu image is also installed on VirtualBox (Ubuntu 11.4.0-
1ubuntu1~22.04). Hydra on the Kali machine will be used to perform the brute force
attack
